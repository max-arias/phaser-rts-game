## TODO

- [ ] DOM UI, interact with the game. Expose and call a function
- [ ] Create objects from map data? Or do it programatically?
- [ ] Implement shared actions / properties (health, movement, speed, etc)
- [ ] Implement a simple action queue for each entity (ie. move, collect resources, move, loop)
- [ ] Basic enemies
