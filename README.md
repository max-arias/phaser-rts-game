## A Generic RTS game

The idea of this project is to create a basic framework for an RTS game. Units, Buildings, Resources, etc.

- [ ] DOM UI, interact with the game. Expose and call a function
- [ ] Create objects from map data? Or do it programatically?
- [ ] Implement shared actions / properties (health, movement, speed, etc)
- [ ] Implement a simple action queue for each entity (ie. move, collect resources, move, loop)
- [ ] Basic enemies
- [ ] Camera movements
- [ ] Fog of War?
- [ ] Title and game over screen
- [ ] Adapt for mobile?
